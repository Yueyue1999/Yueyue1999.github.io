excerpt: 'The results show that the regression model with correlated errors is better than the machine learning-based LSTM algorithm, which is based on the differential MSE performance, and can accurately predict solar power generation.'

In this study, we found high acidy (pH < 3), light pollution (total water soluble ions < 30 μg/m3), and low water content (less than 5 μg/m3) were more correlated with higher rates of sulfate formation than nitrate formation in the winter.
