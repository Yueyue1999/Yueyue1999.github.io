# Welcome to Puyang's Personal Websites! 🚀

# 👋 Hello, I'm Puyang!

## 🎓 Academic Journey
- 📊 Ph.D. student in Biostatistics and Data Science, UT Health Science Center at Houston
- M.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics, University of Melbourne

I am currently a Research Assistant (RA) and Teaching Assistant (TA) at UTHealth, focusing on tobacco control research. My academic journey includes ongoing Ph.D. studies in Biostatistics and Data Science at UT Health Science Center at Houston, preceded by an M.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Melbourne.

## 🔬 Research Interests

My research interests span a wide range of areas in biostatistics and data science, with a particular focus on applications in public health and tobacco control:

- Analysis of data from wearable devices
- Longitudinal & EMA (Ecological Momentary Assessment) data analysis
- Multivariate analysis and time series analysis
- Machine learning applications in health research
- Spatial statistics and Bayesian computation
- Clinical trials design and analysis
- E-cigarette and tobacco use behaviors
- Environmental health impacts

## 📊 Current Projects

I'm currently involved in several exciting projects that leverage advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to address critical issues in public health:

1. Analyzing wearable device data to uncover patterns in tobacco use behaviors
2. Developing machine learning models for predicting vaping cessation outcomes
3. Conducting longitudinal analyses of e-cigarette adoption and usage trends
4. Using EMA studies to investigate environmental triggers for tobacco use

Through these projects, I aim to contribute to the development of more effective strategies for tobacco control and public health interventions.
