# Welcome to Puyang's Digital Den! 🚀

## Who am I? 🤔

## 👋 Hello, I'm Puyang!

Imagine swimming in an ocean of data, using statistical magic to uncover the mysteries of health - that's what I do every day!

🎓 I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics and Data Science at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. My research is like being a data detective, focused on cracking the secrets of nicotine and tobacco, especially e-cigarette use behaviors and their health impacts. 📊

🌏 Before coming to Texas, I delved deep into Mathematics and Statistics at The University of Melbourne, earning my master's degree. There, I mastered the "spells" of statistics and stochastic processes, laying a solid foundation for my current research. 📈

## 🔬 My Research Interests:

- Data Mining: Like an archaeologist, unearthing precious information treasures from vast amounts of data 💎
- Applications of Machine Learning in Health and Behavioral Sciences: Using the power of AI to decipher the puzzles of human behavior 🧠
- And more to explore! I'm always curious and open to new research areas 🚀

## 💡 Why Choose This Field?

I believe that by combining advanced statistical methods with real-world health issues, we can make significant contributions to improving human health. Behind every data point is a real story, and my job is to make these stories heard and understood.

## 🌈 Vision for the Future

I dream of a day when we can harness the power of data and statistics to create a healthier, better world. And now, I'm working hard to make this dream a reality.

Join me on this data adventure! Let's explore the magic of statistics and uncover the mysteries of health together! 🚀✨
