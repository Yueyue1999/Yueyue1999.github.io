# Welcome to Puyang's Digital Den! 🚀

## Who am I? 🤔

Hey there! I'm Puyang, a data enthusiast on a mission to unravel the mysteries of health and behavior through the power of numbers. 🔢✨

## What's my story? 📚

🎓 Currently, I'm navigating the exciting waters of a Ph.D. in Biostatistics and Data Science at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. My research? It's all about blowing smoke... literally! I'm diving deep into the world of nicotine and tobacco, with a special focus on e-cigarette use behaviors and their health impacts. 💨🔬

But wait, there's more! I've got a Master of Science degree in Mathematics and Statistics from The University of Melbourne, where I specialized in Statistics and Stochastic Processes. Talk about a solid foundation for data wizardry! 🧙‍♂️📊

## What makes me tick? 🎯

I'm passionate about:

- 💡 Data Mining: Digging for digital gold in mountains of information
- 🧠 Machine Learning in Health Sciences: Teaching computers to be our health allies
- 🔍 Behavioral Sciences: Decoding the quirks of human nature through data
- 🌟 And so much more! The world of data is my oyster, and I'm always hungry for new challenges!

## Why am I here? 🌐

This website is my digital playground where I share my research, insights, and the occasional data-driven dad joke. Whether you're a fellow data nerd, a curious mind, or just stumbled here by accident, I hope you'll find something to pique your interest!

Ready to embark on a data-driven adventure? Let's crunch some numbers and change the world, one dataset at a time! 🌍📈
